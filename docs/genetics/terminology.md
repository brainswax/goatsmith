- _Allele_ - a variation of a gene
- _Codominant_ - when two dominant alleles can express together
- _Diploid_ - an animal that has two copies of each chromosome; one from the mother and one from the father
- _Dominant_ - an allele is considered dominant if it can be expressed in an animal that only has one copy of the allele
- _Epistatic_ - a gene that changes the expression of another (hypostatic) gene at a different locus
- _Express_ - when a trait is visible on the animal
- _Gene_ - a sequence of one or more nucleotides in a DNA molecule that makes up a basic unity of heredity
- _Genotype_ - the type, or allele, for a gene
- _Heterozygous_ - when the alleles in a pair of genes are different
- _Homozygous_ - when the alleles in a pair of genes are the same
- _Hypostatic_ - a gene that expresses a different phenotype depending on another (epistatic) gene
- _Incomplete Dominance_ - or partial dominance, when a dominant allele doesn't completely mask a recessive allele and creates a blended phenotype
- _Linkage_ - when two genes are near each other and tend to inherit together
- _Locus_ - the location of a gene
- _Loci_ - plural of locus
- _Mendelian Inheritance_ - usually refers to single-gene, single-trait inheritance
- _Phenotype_ - a visible trait
- _Pleiotropic_ - when a single gene affects multiple phenotypes
- _Polygenic_ - when multiple genes interact to produce a phenotype
- _Recessive_ - an allele is considered recessive if it can only be expressed when both alleles in a gene are the same
- _Recessive_ - an allele is recessive if the gene must be homozygous in order to express the trait
- _Wild Type_ - a wild type allele is considered the non-mutated, or wild, variation of a gene
