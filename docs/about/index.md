Full disclosure that I am neither a goat breeder (yet), nor a geneticist. By trade, I'm a software engineer that got interested in breeding through [twitch.tv/thegoatchick](https://twitch.tv/thegoatchick) of [Twin Willows Farm](http://www.twinwillowsfarm.net/).

At some point, I mapped out the [family tree](https://brainswax.github.io/thegoatchick/TwinWillowsFamilyTree.png) of the Twin Willows herd and began decorating it with information about blue eyes, moon spots, polled, and alpha-caesin. Then breeding season came and I started studying the genetics of goat patterns and have been deep diving since.

It's my belief that understanding genetics can be an asset to making proper breeding decisions, but finding that information has been difficult. This is my attempt to collect genetics relavent to goats and to present it in a format that should be consumable by a novice in genetics.
